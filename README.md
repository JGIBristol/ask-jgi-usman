# PCA for Usman

This repository contains two Python scripts:
1. `tidy_data.py`, tidies data sent by Usman into a format without repeated columns.
2. `pca.py`, performs a PCA and visualises the results, on the tidied data.

These scripts were written as part of the [Jean Golding Institute](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/golding/)'s [Ask-JGI Service](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/golding/ask-jgi/).
